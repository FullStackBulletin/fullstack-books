    JavaScript lies at the heart of almost every modern web application, from social apps like Twitter to browser-based game frameworks like Phaser and Babylon. Though simple for beginners to pick up and play with, JavaScript is a flexible, complex language that you can use to build full-scale applications.

    This much anticipated and thoroughly revised third edition of Eloquent JavaScript dives deep into the JavaScript language to show you how to write beautiful, effective code. It has been updated to reflect the current state of JavaScript and web browsers and includes brand-new material on features like class notation, arrow functions, iterators, async functions, template strings, and block scope. A host of new exercises have also been added to test your skills and keep you on track.

    As with previous editions, Haverbeke continues to teach through extensive examples and immerses you in code from the start, while exercises and full-chapter projects give you hands-on experience with writing your own programs. You start by learning the basic structure of the JavaScript language as well as control structures, functions, and data structures to help you write basic programs. Then you'll learn about error handling and bug fixing, modularity, and asynchronous programming before moving on to web browsers and how JavaScript is used to program them. As you build projects such as an artificial life simulation, a simple programming language, and a paint program, you'll learn how to:

    - Understand the essential elements of programming, including syntax, control, and data
    - Organize and clarify your code with object-oriented and functional programming techniques
    - Script the browser and make basic web applications
    - Use the DOM effectively to interact with browsers
    - Harness Node.js to build servers and utilities
    
    Isn't it time you became fluent in the language of the Web?

    Messy code is a nuisance. "Tidying" code, to make it more readable, requires
    breaking it up into manageable sections. In this practical guide, author
    Kent Beck, creator of Extreme Programming and pioneer of software patterns,
    suggests when and where you might apply tidyings to improve your code while
    keeping the overall structure of the system in mind.

    Instead of trying to master tidying all at once, this book lets you try out
    a few examples that make sense for your problem. If you have a big function
    containing many lines of code, you'll learn how to logically divide it into
    smaller chunks. Along the way, you'll learn the theory behind software
    design: coupling, cohesion, discounted cash flows, and optionality.

    This book helps you:

    *   Understand the basic theory of how software design works and the forces
    that act on it
    *   Explore the difference between changes to a system's behavior and
    changes to its structure
    *   Improve your programming experience by sometimes tidying first and
    sometimes tidying after
    *   Learn how to make large changes in small, safe steps
    *   Approach design as a human activity with diverging incentives

    Talking to people about your designs might seem like a basic skill, but it
    can be difficult to do well. In many cases, how you communicate with
    stakeholders, clients, and other nondesigners may be more important than the
    designs themselves. Because if you can't get their support, your work will
    never see the light of day--no matter how good it is.  
      
    This practical guide focuses on principles, tactics, and actionable methods
    for presenting your designs. Whether you design apps, websites, or products,
    you'll learn how to get support from people who have influence over the
    project with the goal of creating the best user experience. 

    *   Walk through the process of preparing and presenting your designs
    *   Understand stakeholder perspectives and learn how to empathize with them
    *   Cultivate both implicit and explicit listening skills
    *   Learn tactics and strategies for expressing the most effective response
    to feedback
    *   Create the right documentation for your decisions to avoid repeated
    conversations
    *   Discover why the way you follow through is just as important as the
    meeting itself

    Move over native apps. New progressive web apps have capabilities that will
    soon make you obsolete. With this hands-on guide, web developers and
    business execs will learn how—and why—to develop web apps that take
    advantage of features that have so far been exclusive to native apps.
    Features that include fast load times, push notifications, offline access,
    homescreen shortcuts, and an entirely app-like experience.

    By leveraging the latest browser APIs, progressive web apps combine all of
    the benefits of native apps, while avoiding their issues. Throughout the
    book, author Tal Ater shows you how to improve a simple website for the
    fictional Gotham Imperial Hotel into a modern progressive web app. Plus:

    *   Understand how service workers work, and use them to create sites that
    launch in an instant, regardless of the user's internet connection
    *   Create full-screen web apps that launch from the phone's homescreen just
    like native apps
    *   Re-engage users with push notifications, even days after they have left
    your site
    *   Embrace offline-first and build web apps that gracefully handle loss of
    connectivity
    *   Explore new UX opportunities and challenges presented by progressive web
    apps

    Designers and managers hope their products become essential for
    users―integrated into their lives like Instagram, Lyft, and others have
    become. Such deep integration isn't accidental: it's a process of careful
    design and iterative learning, especially for technology companies. This
    guide shows you how to apply behavioral science―research that supports many
    products―to help your users achieve their goals using your product.

    In this updated edition, Stephen Wendel, head of behavioral science at
    Morningstar, takes you step-by-step through the process of incorporating
    behavioral science into product design and development. Product managers, UX
    and interaction designers, and data analysts will learn a simple and
    effective approach for identifying target users and behaviors, building the
    product, and gauging its effectiveness.  

    *   Learn the three main strategies to help people change behavior
    *   Identify behaviors your target audience seeks to change―and obstacles
    that stand in their way
    *   Develop effective designs that are enjoyable to use
    *   Measure your product's impact and learn ways to improve it
    *   Combine behavioral science with data science to pinpoint problems and

    One of the world's great designers shares his vision of "the fundamental
    principles of great and meaningful design", that's "even more relevant today
    than it was when first published" (Tim Brown, CEO, IDEO). Even the smartest
    among us can feel inept as we fail to figure out which light switch or oven
    burner to turn on, or whether to push, pull, or slide a door.

    The fault, argues this ingenious -- even liberating -- book, lies not in
    ourselves, but in product design that ignores the needs of users and the
    principles of cognitive psychology. The problems range from ambiguous and
    hidden controls to arbitrary relationships between controls and functions,
    coupled with a lack of feedback or other assistance and unreasonable demands
    on memorization. The Design of Everyday Things shows that good, usable
    design is possible. The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit
    natural relationships that couple function and control, and make intelligent
    use of constraints. The goal: guide the user effortlessly to the right
    action on the right control at the right time. The Design of Everyday Things
    is a powerful primer on how -- and why -- some products satisfy customers
    while others only frustrate them.

    of Web designers and developers have relied on usability guru Steve Krug's
    guide to help them understand the principles of intuitive navigation and
    information design. Witty, commonsensical, and eminently practical, it's one
    of the best-loved and most recommended books on the subject.  
      
    Now Steve returns with fresh perspective to reexamine the principles that
    made Don't Make Me Think a classic-with updated examples and a new chapter
    on mobile usability. And it's still short, profusely illustrated…and best of
    all-fun to read.  
      
    If you've read it before, you'll rediscover what made Don't Make Me Think so
    essential to Web designers and developers around the world. If you've never

    most and doing it well?Does this nagging question haunt you, even when you

    that your life can spent cultivating genuine relationships, investing in
    pursuits you enjoy, and achieving balance in both your personal and

    urgency and importance so that you can focus on what actually needs to be
    done in the limited amount of time that you have. Using personal examples
    and insight from years of business experience, he argues for a new way of
    looking at your “to-do” list. Rather than offering you another clock, First

    From the New York Times-bestselling author of Where Good Ideas Come
    From and Unexpected Life, a new look at the power and legacy of great
    ideas.  
      
    In this illustrated history, Steven Johnson explores the history of
    innovation over centuries, tracing facets of modern life (refrigeration,
    clocks, and eyeglass lenses, to name a few) from their creation by
    hobbyists, amateurs, and entrepreneurs to their unintended historical
    consequences. Filled with surprising stories of accidental genius and
    brilliant mistakes—from the French publisher who invented the phonograph
    before Edison but forgot to include playback, to the Hollywood movie star
    who helped invent the technology behind Wi-Fi and Bluetooth—How We Got to
    Now investigates the secret history behind the everyday objects of
    contemporary life.

    In his trademark style, Johnson examines unexpected connections between
    seemingly unrelated fields: how the invention of air-conditioning enabled
    the largest migration of human beings in the history of the species—to
    cities such as Dubai or Phoenix, which would otherwise be virtually
    uninhabitable; how pendulum clocks helped trigger the industrial revolution;
    and how clean water made it possible to manufacture computer chips.
    Accompanied by a major six-part television series on PBS, How We Got to Now
    is the story of collaborative networks building the modern world, written in
    the provocative, informative, and engaging style that has earned Johnson
    fans around the globe.

    You sit down at your desk to work on an important project, but a
    notification on your phone interrupts your morning. Later, as you're about
    to get back to work, a colleague taps you on the shoulder to chat. At home,
    screens get in the way of quality time with your family. Another day goes
    by, and once again, your most important personal and professional goals are
    put on hold.  
      
    What would be possible if you followed through on your best intentions? What
    could you accomplish if you could stay focused and overcome distractions?
    What if you had the power to become "indistractable"?  
      
    International best-selling author, former Stanford lecturer, and behavioral
    design expert, Nir Eyal, wrote Silicon Valley's handbook for making
    technology habit-forming. Five years after publishing Hooked, Eyal reveals
    distraction's Achilles' heel in his groundbreaking new book.  
      
    In Indistractable, Eyal reveals the hidden psychology driving us to
    distraction. He describes why solving the problem is not as simple as
    swearing off our devices: Abstinence is impractical and often makes us want
    more.  
      
    Eyal lays bare the secret of finally doing what you say you will do with a
    four-step, research-backed model. Indistractable reveals the key to getting
    the best out of technology, without letting it get the best of us.  
      
    Inside, Eyal overturns conventional wisdom and reveals:  
      
    Why distraction at work is a symptom of a dysfunctional company culture -
    and how to fix it  

    What really drives human behavior and why "time management is pain
    management"  

    Why your relationships (and your sex life) depend on you becoming
    indistractable  

    How to raise indistractable children in an increasingly distracting world  

    Empowering and optimistic, Indistractable provides practical, novel
    techniques to control your time and attention - helping you live the life

    This life-changing manifesto shows how you have the potential to make a huge
    difference wherever you are. Few authors have had the kind of lasting
    impact and global reach that Seth Godin has had. In a series of now-classic
    books that have been translated into 36 languages and reached millions of
    readers around the world, he has taught generations of readers how to make
    remarkable products and spread powerful ideas. In Linchpin, he turns his
    attention to the individual, and explains how anyone can make a significant
    impact within their organization.

    There used to be two teams in every workplace: management and labor. Now
    there's a third team, the linchpins. These people figure out what to do when
    there's no rule book. They delight and challenge their customers and peers.
    They love their work, pour their best selves into it, and turn each day into
    a kind of art.

    Have you ever found a shortcut that others missed? Seen a new way to resolve
    a conflict? Made a connection with someone others couldn't reach? Even once?
    Then you have what it takes to become indispensable, by overcoming the
    resistance that holds people back. Linchpin will show you how to join the
    likes of...

    *   Keith Johnson, who scours flea markets across the country to fill
    Anthropologie stores with unique pieces.
    *   Jason Zimdars, a graphic designer who got his dream job at 37signals
    without a résumé.
    *   David, who works at Dean and Deluca coffee shop in New York. He sees every
    customer interaction as a chance to give a gift and is cherished in
    return.

    As Godin writes, "Every day I meet people who have so much to give but have
    been bullied enough or frightened enough to hold it back. It's time to stop
    complying with the system and draw your own map. You have brilliance in you,
    your contribution is essential, and the art you create is precious. Only you
    can do it, and you must."

    The poet Goethe is credited as saying, "What you can do, or dream you can,
    begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it. Begin it, and the
    work will be completed!"  

    If only it were that easy.  

    In any creative effort, the beginning is the hard part, filled with fears
    and procrastinations, and---often most of all-the paralyzing desire to get
    it right on the first try (which almost never happens). Creativity is
    evolutionary; it begins with bad ideas and crappy first efforts and the
    moment we embrace this idea, not eschewing the ugly beginnings but mining
    them for possibilities, our everyday creativity flourishes.  

    Start Ugly is a celebration of the messy creative process and a call to face
    the obstacles of that process with mindfulness and humanity. This is a book
    for anyone who has ever wished they were "more creative." It's a plea to
    stop looking for the muses and inspiration before you do your best work.
    Equal parts needed encouragement to dream big and practical advice for
    getting your hands dirty, START UGLY is a soulful, at times irreverent,
    reminder that creativity is more the stuff of hard work and courage than it
    is the stuff of magic. And if there is magic at all to be found, it's in
    starting.

    In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts
    through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be "positive" all the time
    so that we can truly become better, happier people.

    For decades, we've been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy,
    rich life. "F\*\*k positivity," Mark Manson says. "Let's be honest, shit is
    f\*\*ked and we have to live with it." In his wildly popular Internet blog,
    Manson doesn't sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is—a dose of
    raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art
    of Not Giving a F\*\*k is his antidote to the coddling, let's-all-feel-good
    mindset that has infected modern society and spoiled a generation, rewarding
    them with gold medals just for showing up.


    Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed
    poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn
    lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings
    are flawed and limited—"not everybody can be extraordinary, there are
    winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault."
    Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we
    embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and
    avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the
    courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness
    we seek.


    There are only so many things we can give a f\*\*k about so we need to
    figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is
    nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth
    is about experience. A much-needed
    grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk,
    filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, The Subtle Art
    of Not Giving a F\*ck is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them
    lead contented, grounded lives.
