    JavaScript lies at the heart of almost every modern web application, from social apps like Twitter to browser-based game frameworks like Phaser and Babylon. Though simple for beginners to pick up and play with, JavaScript is a flexible, complex language that you can use to build full-scale applications.

    This much anticipated and thoroughly revised third edition of Eloquent JavaScript dives deep into the JavaScript language to show you how to write beautiful, effective code. It has been updated to reflect the current state of JavaScript and web browsers and includes brand-new material on features like class notation, arrow functions, iterators, async functions, template strings, and block scope. A host of new exercises have also been added to test your skills and keep you on track.

    As with previous editions, Haverbeke continues to teach through extensive examples and immerses you in code from the start, while exercises and full-chapter projects give you hands-on experience with writing your own programs. You start by learning the basic structure of the JavaScript language as well as control structures, functions, and data structures to help you write basic programs. Then you'll learn about error handling and bug fixing, modularity, and asynchronous programming before moving on to web browsers and how JavaScript is used to program them. As you build projects such as an artificial life simulation, a simple programming language, and a paint program, you'll learn how to:

    - Understand the essential elements of programming, including syntax, control, and data
    - Organize and clarify your code with object-oriented and functional programming techniques
    - Script the browser and make basic web applications
    - Use the DOM effectively to interact with browsers
    - Harness Node.js to build servers and utilities
    
    Isn't it time you became fluent in the language of the Web?

    Messy code is a nuisance. "Tidying" code, to make it more readable, requires
    breaking it up into manageable sections. In this practical guide, author
    Kent Beck, creator of Extreme Programming and pioneer of software patterns,
    suggests when and where you might apply tidyings to improve your code while
    keeping the overall structure of the system in mind.

    Instead of trying to master tidying all at once, this book lets you try out
    a few examples that make sense for your problem. If you have a big function
    containing many lines of code, you'll learn how to logically divide it into
    smaller chunks. Along the way, you'll learn the theory behind software
    design: coupling, cohesion, discounted cash flows, and optionality.

    This book helps you:

    *   Understand the basic theory of how software design works and the forces
    that act on it
    *   Explore the difference between changes to a system's behavior and
    changes to its structure
    *   Improve your programming experience by sometimes tidying first and
    sometimes tidying after
    *   Learn how to make large changes in small, safe steps
    *   Approach design as a human activity with diverging incentives

    Talking to people about your designs might seem like a basic skill, but it
    can be difficult to do well. In many cases, how you communicate with
    stakeholders, clients, and other nondesigners may be more important than the
    designs themselves. Because if you can't get their support, your work will
    never see the light of day--no matter how good it is.

    This practical guide focuses on principles, tactics, and actionable methods
    for presenting your designs. Whether you design apps, websites, or products,
    you'll learn how to get support from people who have influence over the
    project with the goal of creating the best user experience.

    *   Walk through the process of preparing and presenting your designs
    *   Understand stakeholder perspectives and learn how to empathize with them
    *   Cultivate both implicit and explicit listening skills
    *   Learn tactics and strategies for expressing the most effective response
    to feedback
    *   Create the right documentation for your decisions to avoid repeated
    conversations
    *   Discover why the way you follow through is just as important as the
    meeting itself

    Move over native apps. New progressive web apps have capabilities that will
    soon make you obsolete. With this hands-on guide, web developers and
    business execs will learn how—and why—to develop web apps that take
    advantage of features that have so far been exclusive to native apps.
    Features that include fast load times, push notifications, offline access,
    homescreen shortcuts, and an entirely app-like experience.

    By leveraging the latest browser APIs, progressive web apps combine all of
    the benefits of native apps, while avoiding their issues. Throughout the
    book, author Tal Ater shows you how to improve a simple website for the
    fictional Gotham Imperial Hotel into a modern progressive web app. Plus:

    *   Understand how service workers work, and use them to create sites that
    launch in an instant, regardless of the user's internet connection
    *   Create full-screen web apps that launch from the phone's homescreen just
    like native apps
    *   Re-engage users with push notifications, even days after they have left
    your site
    *   Embrace offline-first and build web apps that gracefully handle loss of
    connectivity
    *   Explore new UX opportunities and challenges presented by progressive web
    apps

    Designers and managers hope their products become essential for
    users―integrated into their lives like Instagram, Lyft, and others have
    become. Such deep integration isn't accidental: it's a process of careful
    design and iterative learning, especially for technology companies. This
    guide shows you how to apply behavioral science―research that supports many
    products―to help your users achieve their goals using your product.

    In this updated edition, Stephen Wendel, head of behavioral science at
    Morningstar, takes you step-by-step through the process of incorporating
    behavioral science into product design and development. Product managers, UX
    and interaction designers, and data analysts will learn a simple and
    effective approach for identifying target users and behaviors, building the
    product, and gauging its effectiveness.

    *   Learn the three main strategies to help people change behavior
    *   Identify behaviors your target audience seeks to change―and obstacles
    that stand in their way
    *   Develop effective designs that are enjoyable to use
    *   Measure your product's impact and learn ways to improve it
    *   Combine behavioral science with data science to pinpoint problems and

    One of the world's great designers shares his vision of "the fundamental
    principles of great and meaningful design", that's "even more relevant today
    than it was when first published" (Tim Brown, CEO, IDEO). Even the smartest
    among us can feel inept as we fail to figure out which light switch or oven
    burner to turn on, or whether to push, pull, or slide a door.

    The fault, argues this ingenious -- even liberating -- book, lies not in
    ourselves, but in product design that ignores the needs of users and the
    principles of cognitive psychology. The problems range from ambiguous and
    hidden controls to arbitrary relationships between controls and functions,
    coupled with a lack of feedback or other assistance and unreasonable demands
    on memorization. The Design of Everyday Things shows that good, usable
    design is possible. The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit
    natural relationships that couple function and control, and make intelligent
    use of constraints. The goal: guide the user effortlessly to the right
    action on the right control at the right time. The Design of Everyday Things
    is a powerful primer on how -- and why -- some products satisfy customers
    while others only frustrate them.

    information design. Witty, commonsensical, and eminently practical, it's one

    the inner peace, the balance, the confidence that I'm doing what matters
    most and doing it well?Does this nagging question haunt you, even when you

    From the New York Times-bestselling author of Where Good Ideas Come From and
    Unexpected Life, a new look at the power and legacy of great ideas.

    In this illustrated history, Steven Johnson explores the history of
    innovation over centuries, tracing facets of modern life (refrigeration,
    clocks, and eyeglass lenses, to name a few) from their creation by
    hobbyists, amateurs, and entrepreneurs to their unintended historical
    consequences. Filled with surprising stories of accidental genius and
    brilliant mistakes—from the French publisher who invented the phonograph
    before Edison but forgot to include playback, to the Hollywood movie star
    who helped invent the technology behind Wi-Fi and Bluetooth—How We Got to
    Now investigates the secret history behind the everyday objects of
    contemporary life.

    In his trademark style, Johnson examines unexpected connections between
    seemingly unrelated fields: how the invention of air-conditioning enabled
    the largest migration of human beings in the history of the species—to
    cities such as Dubai or Phoenix, which would otherwise be virtually
    uninhabitable; how pendulum clocks helped trigger the industrial revolution;
    and how clean water made it possible to manufacture computer chips.
    Accompanied by a major six-part television series on PBS, How We Got to Now
    is the story of collaborative networks building the modern world, written in
    the provocative, informative, and engaging style that has earned Johnson
    fans around the globe.

    You sit down at your desk to work on an important project, but a
    notification on your phone interrupts your morning. Later, as you're about
    to get back to work, a colleague taps you on the shoulder to chat. At home,
    screens get in the way of quality time with your family. Another day goes
    by, and once again, your most important personal and professional goals are
    put on hold.

    What would be possible if you followed through on your best intentions? What
    could you accomplish if you could stay focused and overcome distractions?
    What if you had the power to become "indistractable"?

    International best-selling author, former Stanford lecturer, and behavioral
    design expert, Nir Eyal, wrote Silicon Valley's handbook for making
    technology habit-forming. Five years after publishing Hooked, Eyal reveals
    distraction's Achilles' heel in his groundbreaking new book.

    In Indistractable, Eyal reveals the hidden psychology driving us to
    distraction. He describes why solving the problem is not as simple as
    swearing off our devices: Abstinence is impractical and often makes us want
    more.

    Eyal lays bare the secret of finally doing what you say you will do with a
    four-step, research-backed model. Indistractable reveals the key to getting
    the best out of technology, without letting it get the best of us.

    Inside, Eyal overturns conventional wisdom and reveals:

    Why distraction at work is a symptom of a dysfunctional company culture -
    and how to fix it

    What really drives human behavior and why "time management is pain
    management"

    Why your relationships (and your sex life) depend on you becoming
    indistractable

    How to raise indistractable children in an increasingly distracting world

    Empowering and optimistic, Indistractable provides practical, novel
    techniques to control your time and attention - helping you live the life
    you really want.

    This life-changing manifesto shows how you have the potential to make a huge
    difference wherever you are.  Few authors have had the kind of lasting
    impact and global reach that Seth Godin has had. In a series of now-classic
    books that have been translated into 36 languages and reached millions of
    readers around the world, he has taught generations of readers how to make
    remarkable products and spread powerful ideas. In Linchpin, he turns his
    attention to the individual, and explains how anyone can make a significant
    impact within their organization.

    There used to be two teams in every workplace: management and labor. Now
    there's a third team, the linchpins. These people figure out what to do when
    there's no rule book. They delight and challenge their customers and peers.
    They love their work, pour their best selves into it, and turn each day into
    a kind of art.

    Have you ever found a shortcut that others missed? Seen a new way to resolve
    a conflict? Made a connection with someone others couldn't reach? Even once?
    Then you have what it takes to become indispensable, by overcoming the
    resistance that holds people back. Linchpin will show you how to join the
    likes of...

    *   Keith Johnson, who scours flea markets across the country to fill
    Anthropologie stores with unique pieces.
    *   Jason Zimdars, a graphic designer who got his dream job at 37signals
    without a résumé.
    *   David, who works at Dean and Deluca coffee shop in New York. He sees every
    customer interaction as a chance to give a gift and is cherished in return.

    As Godin writes, "Every day I meet people who have so much to give but have
    been bullied enough or frightened enough to hold it back. It's time to stop
    complying with the system and draw your own map. You have brilliance in you,
    your contribution is essential, and the art you create is precious. Only you
    can do it, and you must."

    The poet Goethe is credited as saying, "What you can do, or dream you can,
    begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it. Begin it, and the
    work will be completed!"

    If only it were that easy.

    In any creative effort, the beginning is the hard part, filled with fears
    and procrastinations, and---often most of all-the paralyzing desire to get
    it right on the first try (which almost never happens). Creativity is
    evolutionary; it begins with bad ideas and crappy first efforts and the
    moment we embrace this idea, not eschewing the ugly beginnings but mining
    them for possibilities, our everyday creativity flourishes.

    Start Ugly is a celebration of the messy creative process and a call to face
    the obstacles of that process with mindfulness and humanity. This is a book
    for anyone who has ever wished they were "more creative." It's a plea to
    stop looking for the muses and inspiration before you do your best work.
    Equal parts needed encouragement to dream big and practical advice for
    getting your hands dirty, START UGLY is a soulful, at times irreverent,
    reminder that creativity is more the stuff of hard work and courage than it
    is the stuff of magic. And if there is magic at all to be found, it's in
    starting.

    #1 New York Times Bestseller • More than 10 million Copies Sold

    In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts
    through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be "positive" all the time
    so that we can truly become better, happier people.

    For decades, we've been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy,
    rich life. "F\*\*k positivity," Mark Manson says. "Let's be honest, shit is
    f\*\*ked and we have to live with it." In his wildly popular Internet blog,
    Manson doesn't sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is—a dose of
    raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art
    of Not Giving a F\*\*k is his antidote to the coddling, let's-all-feel-good
    mindset that has infected modern society and spoiled a generation, rewarding
    them with gold medals just for showing up.

    Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed
    poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn
    lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings
    are flawed and limited—"not everybody can be extraordinary, there are
    winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault."
    Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we
    embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and
    avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the
    courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness
    we seek.

    There are only so many things we can give a f\*\*k about so we need to
    figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is
    nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth
    is about experience. A much-needed
    grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk,
    filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, The Subtle Art
    of Not Giving a F\*ck is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them
    lead contented, grounded lives.

    Event-driven architecture in Golang is an approach used to develop
    applications that shares state changes asynchronously, internally, and
    externally using messages. EDA applications are better suited at handling
    situations that need to scale up quickly and the chances of individual
    component failures are less likely to bring your system crashing down. This
    is why EDA is a great thing to learn and this book is designed to get you
    started with the help of step-by-step explanations of essential concepts,
    practical examples, and more.

    You'll begin building event-driven microservices, including patterns to
    handle data consistency and resiliency. Not only will you learn the patterns
    behind event-driven microservices but also how to communicate using
    asynchronous messaging with event streams. You'll then build an application
    made of several microservices that communicates using both choreographed and
    orchestrated messaging.

    By the end of this book, you'll be able to build and deploy your own
    event-driven microservices using asynchronous communication.

    What You Will Learn:

    *   Understand different event-driven patterns and best practices
    *   Plan and design your software architecture with ease
    *   Track changes and updates effectively using event sourcing
    *   Test and deploy your sample software application with ease
    *   Monitor and improve the performance of your software architecture

    I wrote the The Road to GraphQL over the last year, while building several
    GraphQL applications for my clients and for myself. During this time, I came
    to understand the practical genius of GraphQL, and how it dramatically
    improves communication in client-server architectures. Not only does it
    improve the interface between the client and the server, it also enhances
    client-side state management by eliminating remote data management.
    Sophisticated GraphQL libraries like Apollo Client provide powerful features
    like caching, optimistic UI, and data prefetching for free. This book covers
    the fundamentals of GraphQL itself, as well as its ecosystem.

    "My absolute favorite for this kind of interview preparation is Steven
    Skiena's The Algorithm Design Manual. More than any other book it helped me
    understand just how astonishingly commonplace … graph problems are -- they
    should be part of every working programmer's toolkit. The book also covers
    basic data structures and sorting algorithms, which is a nice bonus. … every
    1 - pager has a simple picture, making it easy to remember. This is a great
    way to learn how to identify hundreds of problem types." (Steve Yegge, Get
    that Job at Google)

    "Steven Skiena's Algorithm Design Manual retains its title as the best and
    most comprehensive practical algorithm guide to help identify and solve
    problems. … Every programmer should read this book, and anyone working in
    the field should keep it close to hand. … This is the best investment … a
    programmer or aspiring programmer can make." (Harold Thimbleby, Times Higher

    A fascinating exploration of how computer algorithms can be applied to our

    All our lives are constrained by limited space and time, limits that give
    rise to a particular set of problems. What should we do, or leave undone, in
    a day or a lifetime? How much messiness should we accept? What balance of
    new activities and familiar favourites is the most fulfilling? These may
    seem like uniquely human quandaries, but they are not: computers, too, face
    the same constraints, so computer scientists have been grappling with their
    version of such problems for decades. And the solutions they've found have

    The follow-up to Cory Althoff's bestselling The Self-Taught Programmer,
    which inspired hundreds of thousands of professionals to learn to program
    outside of school!

    Fresh out of college and with just a year of self-study behind him, Cory
    Althoff was offered a dream first job as a software engineer for a
    well-known tech company, but he quickly found himself overwhelmed by the
    amount of things he needed to know, but hadn't learned yet. This experience
    combined with his personal journey learning to program inspired his widely
    praised guide, The Self-Taught Programmer. Now Cory's back with another
    guide for the self-taught community of learners focusing on the foundations
    of computer science.

    The Self-Taught Computer Scientist introduces beginner and self-taught
    programmers to computer science fundamentals that are essential for success
    in programming and software engineering fields. Computer science is a
    massive subject that could cover an entire lifetime of learning. This book
    does not aim to cover everything you would learn about if you went to school
    to get a computer science degree. Instead, Cory's goal is to give you an
    introduction to some of the most important concepts in computer science that
    apply to a programming career. With a focus on data structures and
    algorithms, The Self-Taught Computer Scientist helps you fill gaps in your
    knowledge, prepare for a technical interview, feel knowledgeable and
    confident on the job, and ultimately, become a better programmer.

    *   Learn different algorithms including linear and binary search and test
    your knowledge with feedback loops
    *   Understand what a data structure is and study arrays, linked lists,
    stacks, queues, hash tables, binary trees, binary heaps, and graphs
    *   Prepare for technical interviews and feel comfortable working with more
    experienced colleagues
    *   Discover additional resources and tools to expand your skillset and
    continue your learning journey

    It's as simple as this: You have to study computer science if you want to
    become a successful programmer, and if you don't understand computer
    science, you won't get hired. Ready for a career in programming, coding, or
    software engineering and willing to embrace an "always be learning" mindset?
    The Self-Taught Computer Scientist is for you.

    Systems programming provides the foundation for the world's computation.
    Writing performance-sensitive code requires a programming language that puts
    programmers in control of how memory, processor time, and other system
    resources are used. The Rust systems programming language combines that
    control with a modern type system that catches broad classes of common
    mistakes, from memory management errors to data races between threads.

    With this practical guide, experienced systems programmers will learn how to
    successfully bridge the gap between performance and safety using Rust. Jim
    Blandy, Jason Orendorff, and Leonora Tindall demonstrate how Rust's features
    put programmers in control over memory consumption and processor use by
    combining predictable performance with memory safety and trustworthy
    concurrency.

    You'll learn:

    *   Rust's fundamental data types and the core concepts of ownership and
    borrowing
    *   How to write flexible, efficient code with traits and generics
    *   How to write fast, multithreaded code without data races
    *   Rust's key power tools: closures, iterators, and asynchronous
    programming
    *   Collections, strings and text, input and output, macros, unsafe code,
    and foreign function interfaces

    Capturing a wealth of experience about the design of object-oriented
    software, four top-notch designers present a catalog of simple and succinct
    solutions to commonly occurring design problems. Previously undocumented,
    these 23 patterns allow designers to create more flexible, elegant, and
    ultimately reusable designs without having to rediscover the design
    solutions themselves.

    The authors begin by describing what patterns are and how they can help you
    design object-oriented software. They then go on to systematically name,
    explain, evaluate, and catalog recurring designs in object-oriented systems.
    With Design Patterns as your guide, you will learn how these important
    patterns fit into the software development process, and how you can leverage
    them to solve your own design problems most efficiently.

    Each pattern describes the circumstances in which it is applicable, when it
    can be applied in view of other design constraints, and the consequences and
    trade-offs of using the pattern within a larger design. All patterns are
    compiled from real systems and are based on real-world examples. Each
    pattern also includes code that demonstrates how it may be implemented in
    object-oriented programming languages like C++ or Smalltalk.

    You've experienced the shiny, point-and-click surface of your Linux
    computer—now dive below and explore its depths with the power of the command
    line.

    The Linux Command Line takes you from your very first terminal keystrokes to
    writing full programs in Bash, the most popular Linux shell (or command
    line). Along the way you'll learn the timeless skills handed down by
    generations of experienced, mouse-shunning gurus: file navigation,
    environment configuration, command chaining, pattern matching with regular
    expressions, and more.

    In addition to that practical knowledge, author William Shotts reveals the
    philosophy behind these tools and the rich heritage that your desktop Linux
    machine has inherited from Unix supercomputers of yore.

    is shown to be faulty and limiting, but then Crockford shows how to repair
    those problems. He then moves on to data structures and functions, exploring
    the underlying mechanisms and then uses higher order functions to achieve
    class-free object oriented programming. The book also looks at eventual
    programming, testing, and purity, all the while looking at the requirements
    of The Next Language. Most of our languages are deeply rooted in the
    paradigm that produced FORTRAN. Crockford attacks those roots, liberating us
    to consider the next paradigm.He also presents a strawman language and
    develops a complete transpiler to implement it. The book is deep, dense,
    full of code, and has moments when it is intentionally funny."

    As Python continues to grow in popularity, projects are becoming larger and
    more complex. Many Python developers are taking an interest in high-level
    software design patterns such as hexagonal/clean architecture, event-driven

    manage application complexity―and get the most value out of their test
    suites.

    Each pattern is illustrated with concrete examples in beautiful, idiomatic

    In the first edition of this critically acclaimed book, Andrew Hoffman
    defined the three pillars of application security: reconnaissance, offense,
    and defense. In this revised and updated second edition, he examines dozens
    of related topics, from the latest types of attacks and mitigations to
    threat modeling, the secure software development lifecycle (SSDL/SDLC), and
    more.

    Hoffman, senior staff security engineer at Ripple, also provides information
    regarding exploits and mitigations for several additional web application
    technologies such as GraphQL, cloud-based deployments, content delivery
    networks (CDN) and server-side rendering (SSR). Following the curriculum
    from the first book, this second edition is split into three distinct
    pillars comprising three separate skill sets:

    *   Pillar 1: Recon—Learn techniques for mapping and documenting web
    applications remotely, including procedures for working with web
    applications
    *   Pillar 2: Offense—Explore methods for attacking web applications using a
    number of highly effective exploits that have been proven by the best
    hackers in the world. These skills are valuable when used alongside the
    skills from Pillar 3.
    *   Pillar 3: Defense—Build on skills acquired in the first two parts to
    construct effective and long-lived mitigations for each of the attacks
    described in Pillar 2.

    Modern web applications are built on a tangle of technologies that have been
    developed over time and then haphazardly pieced together. Every piece of the
    web application stack, from HTTP requests to browser-side scripts, comes
    with important yet subtle security consequences. To keep users safe, it is
    essential for developers to confidently navigate this landscape.

    In The Tangled Web, Michal Zalewski, one of the world's top browser security
    experts, offers a compelling narrative that explains exactly how browsers
    work and why they're fundamentally insecure. Rather than dispense simplistic
    advice on vulnerabilities, Zalewski examines the entire browser security
    model, revealing weak points and providing crucial information for shoring
    up web application security.

    The Tao of Microservices guides you on the path to understanding how to
    apply microservice architectures to your own real-world projects. This
    high-level book offers a conceptual view of microservice design, along with
    core concepts and their application.

    An application, even a complex one, can be designed as a system of
    independent components, each of which handles a single responsibility.
    Individual microservices are easy for small teams without extensive
    knowledge of the entire system design to build and maintain. Microservice
    applications rely on modern patterns like asynchronous, message-based
    communication, and they can be optimized to work well in cloud and
    container-centric environments.

    What's Inside:

    *   Principles of the microservice architecture
    *   Breaking down real-world case studies
    *   Implementing large-scale systems
    *   When not to use microservices

    The Rust programming language is extremely well suited for concurrency, and
    its ecosystem has many libraries that include lots of concurrent data
    structures, locks, and more. But implementing those structures correctly can
    be very difficult. Even in the most well-used libraries, memory ordering
    bugs are not uncommon.

    In this practical book, Mara Bos, leader of the Rust library team, helps
    Rust programmers of all levels gain a clear understanding of low-level
    concurrency. You'll learn everything about atomics and memory ordering and
    how they're combined with basic operating system APIs to build common
    primitives like mutexes and condition variables. Once you're done, you'll
    have a firm grasp of how Rust's memory model, the processor, and the role of
    the operating system all fit together.

    With this guide, you'll learn:

    *   How Rust's type system works exceptionally well for programming
    concurrency correctly
    *   All about mutexes, condition variables, atomics, and memory ordering
    *   What happens in practice with atomic operations on Intel and ARM
    processors
    *   How locks are implemented with support from the operating system
    *   How to write correct code that includes concurrency, atomics, and locks
    *   How to build your own locking and synchronization primitives correctly

    Accelerate your organization to win in the marketplace.

    How can we apply technology to drive business value? For years, we've been
    told that the performance of software delivery teams doesn't matter―that it
    can't provide a competitive advantage to our companies. Through four years
    of groundbreaking research to include data collected from the State of
    DevOps reports conducted with Puppet, Dr. Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, and
    Gene Kim set out to find a way to measure software delivery performance―and
    what drives it―using rigorous statistical methods. This book presents both
    the findings and the science behind that research, making the information
    accessible for readers to apply in their own organizations.

    Readers will discover how to measure the performance of their teams, and
    what capabilities they should invest in to drive higher performance. This
    book is ideal for management at every level.

    "This is the kind of foresight that CEOs, CFOs, and CIOs desperately need if
    their company is going to survive in this new software-centric world. Anyone
    that doesn't read this book will be replaced by someone that has." ―Thomas

    The book features 33 self-assessment yes-no, fill-the-blank, and multiple
    answer questions to help you evaluate and test your knowledge of Node.js
    secure coding. You'll analyze the code of 6 vulnerable npm packages found
    vulnerable via CVE reports to learn best practices on command injection
    vulnerabilities. With 6 additional references to vulnerable npm packages,
    you'll strengthen your skills in secure coding. This book takes an
    adventure-based approach to application security learning, where you will be
    playing detective who unravels the mysteries of common security
    vulnerabilities. Through these exercises you will learn about secure coding
    practices, and how to avoid security pitfalls that software developers and
    open-source maintainers get caught with. Senior software engineers often
    recite how one of the most critical skills you should have as an engineer is
    the ability to read code. The more you read, the easier it becomes for you
    to understand code and the more context you gain. This book focuses exactly
    on that - reading vulnerable code, so we can learn from it. This activity
    creates patterns that our brain learns to identify and that later quickly
    turn into red flags that we detect and apply in our day-to-day programming
    and code review routines. Through insecure coding practices found in
    vulnerable open-source npm packages, this book examines the security aspects
    affecting JavaScript and Node.js applications. Developers of other languages
    such as Python will find references to insecure code and best practices
    relatively easy to transfer to other server-side languages and software
    ecosystems. By completing this book, you gain: \\* Security expertise in
    mitigating command injection vulnerabilities. \\* Proficiency in performing
    secure code reviews through first-hand analysis of real-world npm libraries
    found vulnerable and their approach to fixing security issues. \\* A
    security-first mindset to recognize patterns of insecure code. \\* Expertise
    in secure coding best practices to avoid command injection security
    vulnerabilities. \\* Knowledge of application security jargon and
    conventions associated with vulnerability management and severity
    classification."

    Today, software engineers need to know not only how to program effectively
    but also how to develop proper engineering practices to make their codebase
    sustainable and healthy. This book emphasizes this difference between
    programming and software engineering.

    How can software engineers manage a living codebase that evolves and
    responds to changing requirements and demands over the length of its life?
    Based on their experience at Google, software engineers Titus Winters and
    Hyrum Wright, along with technical writer Tom Manshreck, present a candid
    and insightful look at how some of the world's leading practitioners
    construct and maintain software. This book covers Google's unique
    engineering culture, processes, and tools and how these aspects contribute
    to the effectiveness of an engineering organization.

    You'll explore three fundamental principles that software organizations
    should keep in mind when designing, architecting, writing, and maintaining
    code:

    *   How time affects the sustainability of software and how to make your
    code resilient over time
    *   How scale affects the viability of software practices within an
    engineering organization
    *   What trade-offs a typical engineer needs to make when evaluating design
    and development decisions.

    Software architecture metrics are key to the maintainability and
    architectural quality of a software project and they can warn you about
    dangerous accumulations of architectural and technical debt early in the
    process. In this practical book, leading hands-on software architects share
    case studies to introduce metrics that every software architect should know.

    This isn't a book about theory. It's more about practice and implementation,
    about what has already been tried and worked. Detecting software
    architectural issues early is crucial for the success of your software: it
    helps mitigate the risk of poor performance and lowers the cost of repairing
    those issues. Written by practitioners for software architects and software
    developers eager to explore successful case studies, this guide will help
    you learn more about decision and measurement effectiveness.

    Through contributions from 10 prominent practitioners, this book shares key
    software architecture metrics to help you set the right KPIs and measure the
    results. You'll learn how to:

    *   Measure how well your software architecture is meeting your goals
    *   Choose the right metrics to track (and skip the ones you don't need)
    *   Improve observability, testability, and deployability
    *   Prioritize software architecture projects
    *   Build insightful and relevant dashboards

    The nature of JavaScript is to be single threaded. This is reflected not
    only in libraries and applications, but also in online forum posts, books,
    and online documentation. Thanks to recent advancements in the platform—such
    as with web workers in the browser, worker\_threads in Node.js, and the
    Atomics and SharedArrayBuffer objects—JavaScript engineers are able to build
    multi-threaded applications. These features will go down as being the
    biggest paradigm shift for the world's most popular programming language.

    Multithreaded JavaScript explores the various features that JavaScript
    runtimes have at their disposal for implementing multithreaded programming,
    using a spectrum of API reference material and high level programming
    patterns.

    An understanding of psychology—specifically the psychology behind how users
    behave and interact with digital interfaces—is perhaps the single most
    valuable nondesign skill a designer can have. The most elegant design can
    fail if it forces users to conform to the design rather than working within
    the "blueprint" of how humans perceive and process the world around them.

    This practical guide explains how you can apply key principles in psychology
    to build products and experiences that are more intuitive and
    human-centered. Author Jon Yablonski deconstructs familiar apps and
    experiences to provide clear examples of how UX designers can build
    experiences that adapt to how users perceive and process digital interfaces.

    You'll learn:

    This first volume in the series begins with basic programming concepts and
    techniques, then focuses more particularly on information structures-the
    representation of information inside a computer, the structural
    relationships between data elements and how to deal with them efficiently.
    Elementary applications are given to simulation, numerical methods, symbolic
    computing, software and system design. Dozens of simple and important
    algorithms and techniques have been added to those of the previous edition.
    The section on mathematical preliminaries has been extensively revised to
    match present trends in research.

  description: Functional-Light JavaScript is a balanced, pragmatic exploration of
    Functional Programming in JavaScript.Functional Programming (FP) is an
    incredibly powerful paradigm for structuring code that yields more robust,
    verifiable, and readable programs. If you've ever tried to learn FP but
    struggled with terms like "monad", mathematical concepts like category
    theory, or symbols like (lambda), you're not alone.Functional-Light
    programming distills the most vital aspects of FP—function purity, value
    immutability, composition, and more!—down to approachable JavaScript
    patterns. Rather than the all-or-nothing dogmatism often encountered in FP,
    this book teaches you how to improve your programs line by line.

    Many organizations today orchestrate and maintain apps that rely on other
    people's services. Software designers, developers, and architects in those
    companies often work to coordinate and maintain apps based on existing
    microservices, including third-party services that run outside their
    ecosystem. This cookbook provides proven recipes to help you get those many
    disparate parts to work together in your network.

    Author Mike Amundsen provides step-by-step solutions for finding,
    connecting, and maintaining applications designed and built by people
    outside the organization. Whether you're working on human-centric mobile
    apps or creating high-powered machine-to-machine solutions, this guide shows
    you the rules, routines, commands, and protocols—the glue—that integrates
    individual microservices so they can function together in a safe, scalable,
    and reliable way.

    *   Design and build individual microservices that can successfully interact
    on the open web
    *   Increase interoperability by designing services that share a common
    understanding
    *   Build client applications that can adapt to evolving services without
    breaking
    *   Create resilient and reliable microservices that support peer-to-peer
    interactions on the web
    *   Use web-based service registries to support runtime "find-and-bind"
    operations that manage external dependencies in real time
    *   Implement stable workflows to accomplish complex, multiservice tasks
    consistently
